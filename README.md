Many legacy Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions rely heavily on manual processes and are tailored for human administrators or data center environments. This makes them unsuitable for complex, dynamic cloud infrastructures. Traditional PAM solutions cannot support large-scale cloud transformation initiatives, which require a modern approach with automated and context-aware access controls.

As we transition to cloud environments, we must redefine our PAM strategies to secure access to the cloud and its workloads. Simply transferring a legacy PAM product to the cloud is neither secure nor scalable. Instead, organizations need a cloud-ready PAM solution to protect against identity-related attacks, the leading cause of data breaches. A modern, cloud-native PAM solution offers unparalleled scalability, high availability, ease of use, and a low total cost of ownership.

When we refer to 'Privileged Access Management in the cloud,' we mean PAM provided as a SaaS solution. 'PAM for the cloud,' on the other hand, pertains to using a PAM solution to manage and secure access to cloud-based systems and services.

Here are five benefits of a modern PAM solution designed specifically for the cloud, which can streamline access management and enhance operational efficiencies.


## 1. Modern PAM Solution Built for the Cloud

Migrating legacy PAM products to virtual machines in the cloud does not alter their fundamental architecture, instead, a modern PAM as a Service solution is necessary. This modern approach reduces complexities and risks through cloud-native security controls. As your infrastructure evolves with new projects in private clouds, new virtual private clouds, or across different cloud platforms, especially during mergers or acquisitions, a cloud-ready platform can seamlessly integrate these elements into your PAM ecosystem. It offers centralized policy management and strict access and privilege controls, accommodating hybrid IT models that scale with your business. Moreover, modern PAM solutions provide essential integrations with leading IT service management software, protecting your existing technology investments.


## 2. A Seamless Experience for All Users

PAM projects often fail due to inconvenient user experiences. Enhancing user experience is crucial for a secure digital business. A modern PAM solution improves the speed and accuracy of granting access with the right privileges at the right time. Quick deployment, automatic updates, and a holistic identity security platform accessible from anywhere are hallmarks of a modern SaaS-delivered PAM solution.


## 3. Enhanced Operational Efficiency

A seamless user experience enhances operational efficiency. Managing privileges in the cloud is challenging due to its scale, with complexities that can introduce security gaps. A modern PAM solution centralizes access control policy administration, providing a single UI for all managed resources. This empowers security and IT teams to manage privileged access efficiently, optimizing operations during routine tasks or critical instances like active cyber-attacks. Simplified user management and administrative experiences offer greater efficiency in controlling access to mission-critical workloads in the cloud.
 

## 4. Higher Identity Assurance at All Touchpoints

Implementing MFA is crucial for verifying the identity of requesters. Legacy MFA approaches relying on static rules are inadequate. Modern cloud-ready PAM solutions support risk-based MFA, utilizing machine learning algorithms and behavioral analytics to detect anomalous or risky activities. Adaptive authentication, aware of device, location, and user behavior, adjusts to the risk level, unlike static one-size-fits-all methods.


## 5. Security and Compliance in the Cloud

Security and compliance apply to both human and machine identities, whether in the cloud or on-premise. Investing in a modern cloud-ready PAM solution ensures proactive identity management by consistently enforcing access policies across hybrid infrastructures, avoiding security gaps. Relying solely on a cloud providerâ€™s default security controls is insufficient for protecting data and meeting compliance requirements. A comprehensive PAM solution offers just-in-time and just enough access, end-to-end monitoring, and detailed audit trails, helping to identify privilege abuse and meet regulatory and cyber insurance requirements. Cloud-ready PAM is essential to your cyber defense strategy, necessitating a reliable and scalable SaaS PAM solution as part of your multi-layered approach to cloud security.
 

## Conclusion

In summary, adopting a modern cloud-ready PAM solution offers significant advantages: it reduces complexities and risks through cloud-native security controls, enhances user experience, boosts operational efficiency, provides higher identity assurance with advanced MFA, and ensures robust security and compliance. By integrating a scalable and reliable PAM solution into your cyber defense strategy, you can better protect your organization against identity-related attacks and streamline access management in today's dynamic cloud environments.
